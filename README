Win32API/ProcessStatus
======================

The ProcessStatus helper functions make it easier for you to obtain
information about processes.

It covers enumerating the currently running processes and their modules.
The results are return in a form as close as possible to the original Win32
API (simple types are returned as scalars of the same type, arrays
as references to arrays and structures as references to hashes with keys
of the same names as the members of the original structures have). There are
only process and module handling functions of the ProcessStatus helper
implemented in this module (in the meanwhile).

These functions are available in Psapi.dll, which is included
in Windows 2000 or higher. To use these functions on Windows NT, you must
obtain the redistributable version of this DLL. It is not included
in Windows 9x.  See the module Win32API::ToolHelp for the similar
functionality for Windows 9x.
